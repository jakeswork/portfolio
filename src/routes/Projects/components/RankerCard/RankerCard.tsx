      The motivation behind Ranker is to provide insight to players on how long it will take
      to achieve a certain goal.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      These calculations were previously being done by players via spreadsheets, however these required some 
      additional knowledge which a large proportion of the player base didn't have.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Packaging the calculations under this UI made the tool extremely user friendly.
